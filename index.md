We are currently working on calculating scattering cross sections and phase shifts for electron and positronium incident on rare-gas atoms. We employ various local and nonlocal approximatation techniques including orthogonalizing pseudopotentials and lagrange multiplier methods to simulate the effect of orthogonality between scattered orbitals. We then compare our results from these approximations against exact calculations and experimental data.
